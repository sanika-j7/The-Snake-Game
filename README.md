# The Snake Game üêç

A simple yet fun implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The goal of the game is to control the snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid colliding with walls or itself.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- **Food**: The snake eats food to grow longer, and the score increases with each piece of food consumed.
- **Collisions**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- **Scoreboard**: Displays the player's score during the game. If the game ends, it shows "Game Over" along with the final score.


## How to Play üéÆ
Use the arrow keys to control the snake:<br>

- Up arrow: Move the snake up<br>
- Down arrow: Move the snake down<br>
- Left arrow: Move the snake left<br>
- Right arrow: Move the snake right<br>
- The snake will grow longer each time it eats food, and your score will increase.<br>

- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will end.<br>
## Game Mechanics
- Snake: The snake is initially made of a few segments. It moves continuously in a chosen direction, and each time it eats food, it grows longer.<br>
- Food: A food item randomly appears on the screen. When the snake collides with the food, it grows longer, and the score increases.<br>
- Walls: The boundaries of the screen are considered walls. The game ends if the snake hits any of the walls.<br>
- Self-Collision: The game ends if the snake collides with its own body.<br>
